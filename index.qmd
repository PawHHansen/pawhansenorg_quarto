Hi, I'm Paw! Good to see you.

I'm a researcher at the [The Danish National Center for Social Science Research](https://www.vive.dk/EN/) where I work on I do experimental behavioral science research related to the public sector. Currently, I study how frontline workers make professional judgements, and how these affect clients. You can find examples of my research [here](link). 

My research interests also include data visualization, Bayesian modeling, and how to communicate statistics and evidence to practitioners in compelling and intuitive ways. I occasionally [blog](link) about these topics.  

When I'm out of office, I enjoy sourdough baking, having coffee with friends, and reading gloomy novels in the evenings. I live in Copenhagen with my wife and our  boy, Jakob.
