# Hi, I'm Paw! It's great to have you here.
 
I'm a researcher at the [Danish Center for Social Science Research](https://www.vive.dk/EN/), where I focus on experimental behavioral science research related to the public sector. Currently, Iâ€™m studying how frontline workers make professional judgments and what impacts these might have on clients. You can explore some examples of my research right [here](https://www.pawhansen.org/research).
 
My research interests also include data visualization, Bayesian modeling, and finding effective ways to communicate statistics and evidence to practitioners in a compelling and intuitive manner. I occasionally write [blog posts](https://www.pawhansen.org/blog) on these subjects.
 
When I'm not in the office, I find joy in sourdough baking, sharing coffee moments with friends, and immersing myself in somber novels during the evenings. I reside in Copenhagen along with my wife and our son, Jakob.
