New post for my [“policy evaluator’s toolbox” series](https://www.pawhansen.org/blog#category=policy%20evaluation)! Today, let's have stab at an instrumental variable analysis. 

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Packages used in this post"

library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(ggsci)
library(modelsummary)
library(estimatr)

theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 12))

```

For more on the details and theory behind IV, have a look at the free online version of [Telling stories with data](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/14-causality_from_obs.html#instrumental-variables). 

### Example 1: How does smoking affect your health?

The problem is that whether people are smoking or not is not random. Rather, it is entangled in all kinds of other factors that might also affect health outcomes: education, gender, job type, and so on. 

IV can help us. Having a tax on smoking will affect whether people smoke or not but not their health _except through smoking status_. 

```{r}
set.seed(853)

num_observations <- 10000

iv_example_data <- tibble(
  person = c(1:num_observations),
  smoker = 
    sample(x = c(0:1), size = num_observations, replace = TRUE)
  )
```

Add health outcomes: 

```{r}
iv_example_data <-
  iv_example_data |>
  mutate(health = if_else(
    smoker == 0,
    rnorm(n = n(), mean = 1, sd = 1),
    rnorm(n = n(), mean = 0, sd = 1)
  ))
```

And then different tax levels on smoking for each of the two provinces:

```{r}
iv_example_data <- iv_example_data |>
  mutate(
    province = case_when(
      smoker == 0 ~ sample(
        c("Nova Scotia", "Alberta"),
        size = n(),
        replace = TRUE,
        prob = c(1/2, 1/2)
      ),
      smoker == 1 ~ sample(
        c("Nova Scotia", "Alberta"),
        size = n(),
        replace = TRUE,
        prob = c(1/4, 3/4)
      )
    ),
    tax = case_when(province == "Alberta" ~ 0.3, 
                    province == "Nova Scotia" ~ 0.5,
                    TRUE ~ 9999999
                    )
    )

iv_example_data
```

A first inspection of the data indicates that smoking does have some effect on health:

```{r}

iv_example_data |> 
  mutate(smoker = as.factor(smoker)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(smoker, health)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = smoker), 
                  alpha = .2) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(province)) +
  scale_color_uchicago() +
  labs(y = "Health status",
       x = "Smoker or not") + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

To estimate the effect, we do as follows:

```{r}
health_on_tax <- lm(health ~ tax, data = iv_example_data)
smoker_on_tax <- lm(smoker ~ tax, data = iv_example_data)

tibble(
  coefficient = c("health ~ tax", "smoker ~ tax", "ratio"),
  value = c(
    coef(health_on_tax)["tax"],
    coef(smoker_on_tax)["tax"],
    coef(health_on_tax)["tax"] / coef(smoker_on_tax)["tax"]
  )
)
```

Another way would be to use `iv_robust()` from the `estimatr` package:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-iv-model
#| tbl-cap: "Instrumental variable example using simulated data"

iv_robust(health ~ smoker | tax, data = iv_example_data) |>
  modelsummary()
```
