To plan this, we need to consider two things. First, what will a useful data set look like? And second, what will the final graph look like? \n\nConcerning our first criterion, a useful data set should include a variable indicating how many times the respondent went to see their doctor for a given period of time. This will be our outcome variable when we get to modeling. In addition, our data set should include one or more predictors. These could be a the individual (i.e. respondent) level or perhaps we might want to consider some form of multilevel modeling - perhaps seeing your doctor or not also depends on things like doctor supply at the state level, your family's total financial resources, and several other factors on primarily found at the individual level. IN iur example here, though, we'll stick with what can be measured at the respondent level. Thus, a useful dataset might look a in [crossref]. \n\nSecond, a useful graph could simply include a plot of the relevant predictors as well as their corresponding uncertainty intervals. [crossref] is one example. \n\n[Make sketches]\n\n### Simulate \n\nNext, we should try to simulate what our dataset might look like as this will prepare us for any challenges we might end up facing once we have acquired the real dataset.  \n\n### Aquire \n\nNow we're ready to aquire a real dataset. A useful one is contained in the `AER` package. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(\"DoctorVisits\")\n\nhead(DoctorVisits)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  visits gender  age income illness reduced health private freepoor freerepat\n1      1 female 0.19   0.55       1       4      1     yes       no        no\n2      1 female 0.19   0.45       1       2      1     yes       no        no\n3      1   male 0.19   0.90       3       0      0      no       no        no\n4      1   male 0.19   0.15       1       0      0      no       no        no\n5      1   male 0.19   0.45       2       5      1      no       no        no\n6      1 female 0.19   0.35       5       1      9      no       no        no\n  nchronic lchronic\n1       no       no\n2       no       no\n3       no       no\n4       no       no\n5      yes       no\n6      yes       no\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Explore\n\n\n### Share\n\n\n",
