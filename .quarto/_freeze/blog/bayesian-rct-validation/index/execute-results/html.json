Basically, we'll be asking two questions:\n\n1. How well does the model fit the data?\n2. How well does the model fit _new_ data?\n\nFor the first question, we will do posterior predictive simulation to see if data simulated from the model has features similar to the original data (which was used to fit the model). \n\nFor the second question, we will \n\nThe packages we'll be using: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rstanarm)\nlibrary(bayesrules)\nlibrary(tidybayes)\nlibrary(bayesplot)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\ntheme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 12))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nRecall our two models from my previous post:\n\n* In one model, I used a _weakly informative prior_ \n* In another, model I used an _evidence-based prior_\n\n\nBefore moving on, we should check the stability of our simulations. \n\nFor the model using a weakly informative prior...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# MCMC trace, density, & autocorrelation plots - weakly informative prior \np1 <- mcmc_trace(fail_model_weakinf) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 5000))\n\np2 <- mcmc_dens_overlay(fail_model_weakinf)\np3 <- mcmc_acf(fail_model_weakinf)\n\np1 / p2 / p3 + plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Diagnostic plots for the stability of our simulation results concerning the model using weakly informative priors.
