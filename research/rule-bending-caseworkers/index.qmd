My first article is out in the [International Public Management Journal](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10967494.2022.2138660)! 

Here's what it's about: When facing a disobedient client, caseworkers are often required to impose sanctions. But even when sanctions are explicitly required by law, research shows that caseworkers may turn a blind eye. Why so? 

The study asks how certain clients can merit themselves to avoid sanctioning.

Drawing from existing literature, I propose that clients can avoid sanctions if they seem (1) needy, (2) hard working, or (3) resourceful.

To test these expectations, I ran a conjoint vignette experiment among Danish unemployment caseworkers. In the experiment, I presented each of 407 caseworkers with 3 fictive client descriptions and asked if the caseworker would sanction that client. Within each client description, I randomly assigned several pieces of information concerning the three types of deserving clients above.  

Importantly, according to policy rules, _all_ clients should have been sanctioned, yet for many of the client profiles caseworkers were unwilling to impose sanctions.  

Interestingly, caseworkers tended to favor stronger clients when bending the rules: Clients who appeared motivated, had not been sanctioned in the past, or had years of previous job experience were all less likely to be sanctioned.

This is a bit of paradox: Although welfare usually targets clients in _need_, avoiding welfare sanctions seems based on client _resources_. Consequently, caseworker rule-bending can have unintended distributional consequences since stronger clients are those who can get away with disobedience.

Here is key figure from the paper:
